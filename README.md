### Useful tools
#### Development server
Run `ionic serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8100/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

If you want to run the cordova wrapped version in the the you can run `ionicc cordova run browser` to run the project in browser. Or, `ionic cordova run android` for running the project in android (make sure you have an actual device or a virtual device connected).
